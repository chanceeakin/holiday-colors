# Holiday Colors

> ⚠️ This project is in active development. Expect the API to change until a stable (1.0) release.

## What

A collection of functions that trigger website theme/style changes based on date/time of year.

## Why

I really want to change the style/theme of my app without updating colors manually.

## Roadmap to v0.2

- build out date functions for:
  - Valentine's Day
  - Thanksgiving
  - Christmas
- Build out default themes
- tests

## Want to contribute?

Feel free to open a ticket/issue/PR or reach out here.
