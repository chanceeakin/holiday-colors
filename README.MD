# Holiday Colors

## What

A collection of functions that trigger website theme/style changes based on date/time of year.

## Why

I really want to change the style on my website without updating colors.

## Example usage

Black Friday colors/theme for a website. Halloween colors that roll straight into Thanksgiving themes which roll straight into Christmas.

## Roadmap to v1

- build out date functions for:
  - Valentine's Day
  - Thanksgiving
  - Christmas
- Build out default themes
- tests
- CI/CD
